  <h1>Background Information! </h1>
 
 <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
 <h3>Acid/Base solutions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In healthy patients about 16,000–20,000 mmol/day of carbon dioxide (CO2), derived from oxidation of nutrients containing carbon, are produced.</li>
    
    <li>an alteration in respiratory exchanges, as occurs in advanced phase of COPD, results in retention of CO2. Carbon dioxide is then hydrated with the formation of carbonic acid that subsequently dissociates with release of hydrogen ions (H+) in the body fluids</li>

    <li>CO2+H2O⇒H2CO3⇒HCO3+H+</li>

    <li>the consequence of hypercapnia due to alteration of gas exchange in COPD patients mainly consists in increase of H+ concentration and development of respiratory acidosis</li>

  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
 <h3>pH Calculations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>According to traditional method to assess acid-base status, the Henderson-Hasselbach equation expresses relationship between pH (logarithm of inverse concentration of H+), bicarbonate ion concentration (−HCO3), and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2): pH=6.1+logHCO3−/0.03pCO2.</li>
    
    <li>the pH and the concentration of hydrogen ions are strictly determined by the bicarbonate/pCO2 ratio, rather than their individual values. A change in pH can thus be determined by a primitive alteration of numerator eof this equation, that is, bicarbonate (metabolic disorders) or of denominator, that is, pCO2 (respiratory disorders). </li>

    <li>the compensation to respiratory acidosis consists in a secondary increase in bicarbonate concentration, and the arterial blood gas analysis is characterized by a reduced pH, increased pCO2 (initial variation), and increased bicarbonate levels (compensatory response).</li>


  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
  <h3>Acid/Base Equilibrium</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Water is present in all acid-base chemistry and is amphoteric in nature. The Ka and Kb values can be used to determine the strength of an acid or a base. Titrations can be used to student neutralization reactions between strong and weak acids and bases.Feb 18, 2014</li>

    <li>if the disorder is likely to be more chronic, therapy aimed at restoring metabolic acid–base balance is indicated. </li>

    <li>the therapeutic target can be estimated initially from the standard base excess (SBE). The SBE corresponds to the amount of strong acid or base that must be added in order to restore the pH to 7.4, assuming a Pco2 of 40 mmHg. Thus, if SBE is −10 mEq/L, 10 mEq/L of strong base would need to be added (or equal amounts of strong acid removed) to return the equilibrium to normal.</li>


  </ul>
 </div>

 <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
  <h3>Neutralization reactions and Buffers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A neutralization reaction is when an acid and a base react to form water and a salt and involves the combination of H+ ions and OH- ions to generate water. The neutralization of a strong acid and strong base has a pH equal to 7.</li>

    <li>The response to respiratory acidosis occurs in a different extent either in acute or chronic phase.</li>

    <li>H2CO3+Hb−⇒HHb+HCO3.−</li>

    <li>The effectiveness of this mechanism is limited. In such condition, for every increase of 10 mmHg pCO2 we expect only 1 mEq increase in bicarbonate concentration </li>

    <li>H+ excretion across apical membrane occurs by a Na+/H+ antiporter (NHE3) and to a lesser extent by a proton pump. The secreted H+ into the tubular fluid combines with filtered bicarbonate ions leading to carbonic acid formation.</li>

  </ul>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p class="container">
Your blood needs the right balance of acidic and basic (alkaline) compounds to function properly. This is called the acid-base balance. Your kidneys and lungs work to maintain the acid-base balance. Even slight variations from the normal range can have significant effects on your vital organs. When the levels of acid in your blood are too high, it’s called acidosis. 
<br /><br />
When your blood is too alkaline, it is called alkalosis. Respiratory acidosis and alkalosis are due to a problem with the lungs. Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are due to a problem with the kidneys. When you breathe, your lungs remove excess carbon dioxide from your body. 
<br /><br />
When they cannot do so, your blood and other fluids become too acidic. Symptoms of respiratory acidosis include fatigue, shortness of breath, and confusion. Causes of respiratory acidosis include chest deformities or injuries, chronic lung and airway diseases, overuse of sedatives, and obesity.
<br /><br />
 You can take steps to help prevent some of the conditions that lead to respiratory acidosis. Maintain a healthy weight. Take sedatives only under strict doctor supervision and never combine them with alcohol. Do not smoke.
